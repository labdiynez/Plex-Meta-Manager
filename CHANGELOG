# Bug Fixes
Fixed `(404) not_found` error that presented itself in PMS 1.32.7, as outlined [here](https://discord.com/channels/822460010649878528/1099773891733377065/1174751954367422585)
Fixed issue that would prevent `file_poster` from overriding `url_poster` in the PMM Defaults.
Removed `--cache-libraries` Environment Variable due to inconsistent behaviour that could cause issues.
Fixed issue with `mass_poster_update` incorrectly updating episode posters when it shouldn't.
Fixed issue with `delete_collection_named` running in a collection even if the collection wasn't scheduled to run.
