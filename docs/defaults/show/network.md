# Network Collections

The `network` Default Metadata File is used to dynamically create collections based on the networks available in your library.

## Requirements & Recommendations

Supported Library Types: Show

## Collections Section 050

| Collection                          | Key                                 | Description                                                                 |
|:------------------------------------|:------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Network Collections`               | `separator`                         | [Separator Collection](../separators) to denote the Section of Collections. |
| `<<network>>`<br>**Example:** `NBC` | `<<network>>`<br>**Example:** `NBC` | Collection of Shows the aired on the network.                               |

## Config

The below YAML in your config.yml will create the collections:

```yaml
libraries:
  TV Shows:
    metadata_path:
      - pmm: network
```

## Template Variables

Template Variables can be used to manipulate the file in various ways to slightly change how it works without having to make your own local copy.

Note that the `template_variables:` section only needs to be used if you do want to actually change how the defaults work. Any value not specified is its default value if it has one if not it's just ignored.

All [Shared Collection Variables](../collection_variables) are available as well as the additional Variables below which can be used to customize the file.

This file contains a [Separator](../separators) so all [Shared Separator Variables](../separators.md#shared-separator-variables) are available as well.

1. Each default collection has a `key` that when calling to effect a specific collection you must replace `<<key>>` with when calling.

The below is an example config.yml extract with some Template Variables added in to change how the file works.

```yaml
libraries:
  TV Shows:
    metadata_path:
      - pmm: network
        template_variables:
          use_separator: false
          sep_style: stb
          append_exclude:
            - BBC
          sort_by: title.asc
```


## Default values

These are lists provided for reference to show what values will be in use if you do no customization.  If you want to customize these values, use the methods described above.  These do not show how to change a name or a list.
